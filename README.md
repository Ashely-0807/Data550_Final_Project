To build the Docker image, run the following command from the project root directory (where the Dockerfile is located):
  - In bash run `docker build -t ashley0807/final_project2 .`

## Build the report by running a docker from `Makefile` 
  - In bash run `make docker_report'`

---
## Synchronize your package repository (This runs: `renv::restore()`)
  - Clone the repository
  - Install all required R packages with: `make install` in `Git bash`
  -If you add or update packages, run: `renv::snapshot()`
---
## How to generate the final report?

  - run `make .rds_outputs` in `Git bash` for generating tables and figures from `Makefile `
  - then run `make finalproject_RZCHEN_1027.pdf`in `Git bash`for generating pdf document from `Makefile`
  
## Wich pieces of code create the table and figure?

**Generate tables and figures**

`code/01_make_output1.R`

  - generates all tables and figures
  - saves all tables and figures as a `.rds` object in `output/` folder

`code/02_render_report.R`

  - renders `finalproject_RZCHEN_1027.Rmd`

`finalproject_RZCHEN_1027.Rmd`

  - reads tables and figures generated by `code/01_make_output1.R`
  - makes three tables and two figures
